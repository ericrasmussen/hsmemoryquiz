-- * Helper functions private to this module

-- | Formats integers x and y as a string in the form "x/y"
formatFraction :: Int -> Int -> String
formatFraction x y = show x ++ "/" ++ show y

-- | Divides two Integers as doubles and formats the result as a percentage in

-- displaying "0%".

isWhole :: RealFrac a => a -> Bool
isWhole x = floor x == ceiling x

-- | Display a question in a prompt format
questionPrompt :: Question -> String
questionPrompt Question { question=q } = "> " ++ q ++ ": "

-- | Prompt for a line and exit on exception.
-- Note that Interrupt exceptions (ctrl-c) must be handled separately with
-- handleInterrupt, but we also need to check the result of getInputLine for the
-- Nothing case, which indicates an EOF exception.
