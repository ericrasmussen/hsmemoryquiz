-- * Quiz types and functions on quizzes

-- | The exported Quiz type that wraps our ErrorT, StateT, and IO stack
newtype Quiz a = Quiz {
  getQuiz :: ErrorT String (StateT QuizState IO) a
  } deriving (Monad, MonadIO, MonadError String, MonadState QuizState)


-- | Takes a starting QuizState and evaluates a Quiz block
runQuiz :: QuizState -> Quiz a -> IO (Either String a, QuizState)
runQuiz scoreBoard k = runStateT (runErrorT (getQuiz k)) scoreBoard



-- | Keep track of the score (number of correct answers) and the total questions
-- asked. Also contains a generator that knows how to create a Question from a
-- given Association.
data QuizState = QuizState {
    score        :: Int
  , total        :: Int
  -- TODO: ideally these last two would be in a Reader
  , genQuestion  :: Association -> Question
  , associations :: AssociationDB
  }


-- | Make our QuizState pretty for console output
-- The resulting string will be in the form: score/total (percentage)
instance Show QuizState where
  show QuizState {score=s, total=t} = fraction ++ " (" ++ percentage ++ ")"
    where fraction   = formatFraction   s t

-- * Questions!

type Response      = String

-- | Our primary question type with a showable question and a predicate to check
-- an answer
data Question = Question {
    question  :: String
  , evaluator :: Response -> Result
  }

instance Show Question where
  show Question { question=q } = q


-- | Create a reusable function to generate Questions from Associations

checkResponse (Question {evaluator=eval}) response = eval response

-- | Run a continuous game in our Quiz monad. Takes as its sole argument a
-- function to produce an Int to be used to access the next association. This
-- can be used to swap strategies, such as asking questions in a random order,
-- asking in order, asking in reverse, etc.

-- * Helper functions private to this module

-- | Formats integers x and y as a string in the form "x/y"

-- | Divides two Integers as doubles and formats the result as a percentage in

-- | Basic question prompt
prompt :: Question -> IO ()

questionPrompt :: Question -> String
