hsmemoryquiz
============

A demo app to show off some haskell basics.

Written primarily to serve as a relatively concise example application with all
the components sometimes left out of haskell tutorials, including command line
flags, parsing files, monad transformers with state and error handling,
documentation, and tests.

It's also useful as an application for practicing the Dominic memory system,
which requires some initial work on your part that is as-of-yet completely
undocumented.

Very much a work in progress. Much refactoring to come as time allows.
